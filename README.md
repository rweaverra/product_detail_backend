The product detail page will show relevant information for a single product in the catalogue.

## Product Detail Page
The product detail page will show relevant information for a single product in the catalogue.  Our catalogue is organized by *products*.  One single product can be associated with many sizes and styles which each result in unique SKUs (stock keeping units).  The product detail page will present items at the product level.  Further breakdown by style or size will only be reflected within the product detail page.

The same product detail page will be shown for every product in the catalogue.  Upon navigating to the product detail page or selecting a new product to display, the contents of the page will update to show information relevant to the selected product. 

The item detail page will be comprised of distinct modules.  Each module will display information related to the product being displayed.
